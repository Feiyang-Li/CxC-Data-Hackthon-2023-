columns with the `feat_*` prefix are boolean, integer, or float features that describe the residue itself.  These can be used for training a model.  Domain knowledge of these values should not be necessary to participate in the challenge, but we've provided brief descriptions below for anyone who may be interested:\n","\n","* `feat_[letter]` are one-hot encoded boolean values for each of the 20 possible amino acids.\n","* `feat_PHI`, `feat_PSI`, `feat_TAU`, `feat_THETA` describe various protein chain bonding angles, computed with [Biopython](https://biopython.org/docs/1.75/api/Bio.PDB.Polypeptide.html).\n","* `feat_BBSASA`, `feat_SCSASA` describe the solvent accessible surface area, calculated using [FreeSASA](https://freesasa.github.io/).\n","* `feat_pLDDT` is an AlphaFold2 residue-level prediction confidence value.\n","* `feat_DSSP_[letter]` are secondary structure assignments by [DSSP].(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSSP_(algorithm))\n","* `feat_DSSP_[number]` are other backbone structural features describing backbone hydrogen. bonding networks, also assigned by [DSSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSSP_(algorithm)).\n","\n","Column `y_Ligand` indicates if the residue (row) belongs to a known binding site or not.  This column is the classification objective for our challenge. \n","\n","The remaining columns describe other elements of the protein structure for reference or troubleshooting purposes.  Participants may use this information to to engineer new features/representations in their models if they so choose. These include:\n","* `annotation_sequence` and `annotation_atomrec`: Residue amino acid in character format.\n","* `entry`: Protein name, can be looked up on Uniprot for more information about the protein.  Each unique entry is one unique protein structure in this dataset.\n","* `coord_X`, `coord_Y`, `coord_Z`: XYZ coordinates of the residue in the respective protein structure.  For example, all residues for protein 'QCR1_HUMAN' belong to the same coordinate space, but the coordinate space would shared between two residues (rows) with `entry` values of 'QCR1_HUMAN' and 'PPM1A_HUMAN'.\n","* `entry_index`: The order of the amino acid within the protein sequence.  As with coordinates, these relationships are only meaningful for rows (residues) that share the same `entry` value.  For example, within QCR1_HUMAN two residues (rows) with `entry_index` 5 and 6 are adjacent (connected) neighbors.\n","\n","The test dataset has the same format, but is otherwise missing the `y_Ligand` column.
